            collection of all people born on each day -- this is used to
            age people on their birthdays; we start with (2, 29) initialized because
            we need to perform a check every March 1 to ensure that all leap-year babies

            Prepare a number that will hold a single random number
            that is generated daily -- this facilitates certain things
            that should be determined randomly but remain constant across
            a timestep, e.g., whether a person locked their door before leaving home
