You are always in my thoughts,
Your love is still my guide,
And though I cannot touch your hand,
I know you are by my side


You taught us many things in life 
That we would have to do 
But you never taught us how to cope
With the hurt of losing you


Though absent you are always near,
Still loved, still missed and very dear


Sweet are the Memories that never fade


Love makes memory eternal


Beautiful memories left behind


Gone from our home but not from our hearts


Memory is a golden chain that binds us till we meet again


For all of us you did your best 
May you have eternal rest


To live in the hearts of those we love is not to die


A tiny flower lent not given, to bud on Earth and bloom in Heaven (for infant gravestone)


Too good in life to be forgotten in death


The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen nor touched but are felt in the heart


Gone is the face we loved so dear, silent the voice we loved to hear


Deep in our hearts your memory is kept, To love and to cherish and never forget


Sadly missed along life's way, Quietly remembered every day


In our hearts you will always stay, loved and remembered every day


Peace is thine and sweet remembrance is ours


Our Happiness Together
Are Memories Forever


Softly the leaves of memory fall,
Gently I gather and treasure them all,
Unseen, unheard you are always near,
So missed so loved so very dear


Gone but not forgotten


If love could have saved you, you would have lived forever


How beautiful life was to me


We lived together in happiness, we rest together in peace


Forever young, forever in our hearts


Gone from home but not from our hearts
